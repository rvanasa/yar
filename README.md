# Yar - Your augmented reality

Yar is a work-in-progress platform for designing applications centered around geographic location and augmented reality.
Think Pokémon Go, except layers upon layers of useful day-to-day applications instead of just a bunch of Pokémon. 

In essence, the Yar platform provides an application layer on top of Google Maps in order to allow any number of specified user-aware applications to interoperate within one app/website. 

Yar is currently a rather young project, and as such there are many opportunities to contribute.
As such, definitely shoot me an email if you would like to be part of the team!
